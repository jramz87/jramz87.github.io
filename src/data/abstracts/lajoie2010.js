`Light absorption by nanostructured surfaces of silicon, relevant to
the capture of solar radiation, has been modeled starting from their atomic
structure and calculating electronically excited states. Thin, two-layer silicon slabs
were cut from a model optimized amorphous supercell and studied to elucidate
the effect of adsorbate geometry and size for small silver clusters chemisorbed
onto the hydrogen-passivated semiconductor surface. Density functional (DFT) and
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods were performed to calculate optical
properties of the amorphous Agn/a-Si surface. Optimized geometries, density of
states, band gap and binding energies, and excited-stated spectra and oscillator
strengths have been calculated within the DFT and TD-DFT approaches. The
results demonstrate the correlation between these properties and the size of the
systems, and are compared with those we previously obtained for the
corresponding crystalline Agn/Si(111) surfaces. Similar trends are observed for the
amorphous and crystalline silicon slabs as the number of silver atoms included in
the clusters were increased. Our results demonstrate that Agn clusters adsorbed
on amorphous slabs are significant contributors to increased light absorption of
lower energy photons.`;
