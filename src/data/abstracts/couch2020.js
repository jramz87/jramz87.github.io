`Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) light is critical for the study of molecules and materials, but the generation 
of femtosecond pulses in the VUV region at high repetition rates has proven difficult. Here we demonstrate
the efficient generation of VUV light at megahertz repetition rates using highly cascaded four-wave mixing 
processes in a negative-curvature hollow-core fiber. Both even- and odd-order harmonics are generated up 
to the 15th harmonic (69 nm, 18.0 eV), with high energy resolution of ~40 mEV. In contrast to direct high 
harmonic generation, this highly cascaded harmonic generation process requires lower peak intensity and 
therefore can operate at higher repetition rates, driven by a robust ~ 10 W fiber-laser system in a compact setup. 
Additionally, we present numerical simulations that explore the fundamental capabilities and spatiotemporal 
dynamics of highly cascaded harmonic generation. This VUV source can enhance the capabilities of spectroscopies 
of molecular and quantum materials, such as photoionization mass spectrometry and time-, angle-, and spin-resolved 
photoemission.`;
